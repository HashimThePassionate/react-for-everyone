# **What Are Components**?

A key concept of React is the use of **components**.
Components are **reusable building blocks** that together compose the final **User Interface (UI)**.

👉 **Example:**
A simple website could be built from:

* **Sidebar** — containing navigation items
* **Main Section** — containing elements for adding and viewing tasks

## 📘 **React — Components**

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/01.png"/>

## 🔍 Example Breakdown

If you look at the example page above, you can identify different **components**.

### 🔹 Components visible in the UI:

* **Sidebar** and its **navigation items**
* **Main page area**
* **Header in the main area** (with title and due date)
* **Form** (for adding tasks)
* **Task list**

## 🔄 Reusability & Nesting

⚡ One of the most **powerful features** of React is:

* **Components can be reused** (the same component can be used in multiple places).
* **Components can be nested inside each other** — meaning one component can contain another.

👉 That’s what makes React and similar libraries **efficient and modular**.
