# ‚ú® **Working with Events and State in React**=

**State**, is a fundamental React feature that empowers developers to manage internal component data. By adjusting this data, you can trigger updates to the User Interface (UI). We will also delve into handling user events, such as button clicks or text input, to create dynamic and interactive applications.

---

## üéØ The Challenge: Static User Interfaces

Currently, any React application we build has a significant limitation: it's **static**. The UI is fixed and cannot change in response to user actions.

To better understand this issue, let's examine a typical React component.

### Example: A Static Email Input

Consider the following `EmailInput` component:

```javascript
function EmailInput() {
  return (
    <div>
      <input placeholder="Your email" type="email" />
      <p>The entered email address is invalid.</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Code Explanation

  * **`function EmailInput() { ... }`**: This defines a standard React functional component named `EmailInput`.
  * **`return ( ... );`**: The component returns JSX, which describes the UI structure.
  * **`<div>`**: A container element.
  * **`<input placeholder="Your email" type="email" />`**: An HTML input field designed for email addresses.
  * **`<p>The entered email address is invalid.</p>`**: A paragraph element that displays an error message.

You might wonder why the error message is permanently displayed. The goal is to show this paragraph *only* when the user has entered an invalid email. Ideally, the application should:

1.  Wait for the user to type in the input field.
2.  Evaluate the input after the user is finished (e.g., when the input field loses focus).
3.  Display the error message only if the email is invalid (e.g., it's empty or missing an `@` symbol).

With our current knowledge, this dynamic behavior is impossible to implement. The error message is always visible because there's no mechanism to change the UI based on user events or changing conditions. In short, the application is **static**, not **dynamic**. This is the core problem we aim to solve.

-----

## ‚ùå An Incorrect Approach: Direct DOM Manipulation

How might we attempt to make the `EmailInput` component dynamic? One might consider a traditional JavaScript approach.

**Spoiler Alert:** The following code will **not work** as intended in a React component file and is presented here as an example of what *not* to do.

```javascript
function EmailInput() {
  return (
    <div>
      <input placeholder="Your email" type="email" />
      <p></p>
    </div>
  );
};

// --- This part is the incorrect approach ---
const input = document.querySelector('input');
const errorParagraph = document.querySelector('p');

function evaluateEmail(event) {
  const enteredEmail = event.target.value;
  if (enteredEmail.trim() === '' || !enteredEmail.includes('@')) {
    errorParagraph.textContent = ' The entered email address is invalid.';
  } else {
    errorParagraph.textContent = '';
  }
};

input.addEventListener('blur', evaluateEmail);
```

### Code Explanation

This approach attempts to use standard browser APIs to manipulate the DOM elements rendered by React.

  * **`const input = document.querySelector('input');`**: This line uses the browser's DOM API to select the first `<input>` element on the page.
  * **`const errorParagraph = document.querySelector('p');`**: Similarly, this selects the first `<p>` element.
  * **`function evaluateEmail(event) { ... }`**: This function is designed to handle the validation logic.
      * **`const enteredEmail = event.target.value;`**: It extracts the current value from the input field that triggered the event.
      * **`if (enteredEmail.trim() === '' || !enteredEmail.includes('@'))`**: This condition checks if the email is empty (after trimming whitespace) or does not contain an `@` symbol.
      * **`errorParagraph.textContent = '...';`**: If the email is invalid, it directly sets the text content of the paragraph to show the error message.
      * **`else { errorParagraph.textContent = ''; }`**: If the email is valid, it clears the paragraph's text content, hiding the message.
  * **`input.addEventListener('blur', evaluateEmail);`**: This attaches an event listener to the input field. The `evaluateEmail` function will be executed whenever the `blur` event occurs (i.e., when the user clicks away from the input field).

This code fails because you cannot reliably select React-rendered DOM elements in this manner from within the same component file. While you might find a workaround (like placing the code in a `setTimeout` callback) to make it execute after React renders the elements, it fundamentally goes against the principles of React.

-----

## üß† Imperative vs. Declarative: The React Philosophy

Even if the direct manipulation code could be made to work, it represents a flawed strategy. Here's why:

> It‚Äôs **imperative code**\! This means you are writing step-by-step instructions on what the browser should do. You are not declaring the desired end state; you are instead describing a specific path to get there, and this path does not involve React.

React's core philosophy is to be **declarative**. You describe the final UI state you want, and you let React manage the complex, step-by-step DOM manipulations required to achieve it.

By writing imperative code, you are working **against** React, not with it. This isn't just a philosophical disagreement; it creates tangible problems:

  * **Increased Complexity**: You are forced to manually solve problems that React is designed to handle automatically. This leads to more code and more effort.
  * **Missed Optimizations**: You bypass React's internal reconciliation algorithm, potentially missing out on performance optimizations that React provides under the hood.
  * **Bugs and Poor Performance**: Your manual solution is more likely to be buggy and less performant than React's optimized approach.
  * **Maintenance Nightmare**: The `EmailInput` example is simple. Imagine building a complex application like an online store, a vacation rental site, or Google Docs. Managing hundreds of dynamic UI elements by mixing React with vanilla JavaScript would quickly become unmanageable.

In essence, by avoiding the tools React provides, you make your job as a developer harder and compromise the quality of your application. The benefits of using a declarative library like React are lost when you revert to imperative DOM manipulation. To fully grasp these advantages, it's helpful to understand React's foundational concepts of components and JSX.

# üí° **A Better, Yet Flawed, Solution**

The previous naive approach presents significant challenges. It requires complex workarounds, like using `setTimeout()` to delay code execution, and results in logic being scattered across component functions, external scopes, and potentially unrelated files.

Let's explore an improved solution that attempts to embrace React's component-centric model.

-----

### The Proposed Code

This version contains all the logic within the component itself.

```javascript
function EmailInput() {
  let errorMessage = '';

  function evaluateEmail(event) {
    const enteredEmail = event.target.value;
    if (enteredEmail.trim() === '' || !enteredEmail.includes('@')) {
      errorMessage = 'The entered email address is invalid.';
    } else {
      errorMessage = '';
    }
  };

  const input = document.querySelector('input');
  input.addEventListener('blur', evaluateEmail);

  return (
    <div>
      <input placeholder="Your email" type="email" />
      <p>{errorMessage}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Code Explanation

  * **`let errorMessage = '';`**: A local variable `errorMessage` is declared and initialized as an empty string. This variable is intended to hold the validation message.
  * **`function evaluateEmail(event) { ... }`**: This is the same validation function as before. However, instead of directly manipulating a DOM element's text, it updates the `errorMessage` variable.
  * **`const input = document.querySelector('input');`**: This line again attempts to select the `<input>` element from the DOM.
  * **`input.addEventListener('blur', evaluateEmail);`**: This attaches the `blur` event listener to the selected input, aiming to trigger the `evaluateEmail` function.
  * **`<p>{errorMessage}</p>`**: In the JSX, the `errorMessage` variable is rendered inside the paragraph tags. The goal is for React to display the current value of this variable in the UI.

-----

### ‚úÖ What This Approach Gets Right

Although this code is also non-functional, it is a significant step in the right direction. It more closely follows the React philosophy for two key reasons:

1.  **Encapsulation**: All the logic‚Äîthe variable holding the message, the validation function, and the event handling‚Äîis contained entirely within the `EmailInput` component function to which it belongs.
2.  **Declarative UI**: The error message is managed via the `errorMessage` variable, which is directly included in the JSX (`<p>{errorMessage}</p>`). This is a more declarative pattern where the UI "declares" that it should display whatever is in that variable.

> The core idea behind this improved solution is correct: **the React component that controls a UI element should also be responsible for its state and events.**

-----

### ‚ùå The Two Critical Flaws

Despite its better structure, this approach is still destined to fail for two fundamental reasons:

1.  **DOM Selection Fails**: The code `document.querySelector('input')` executes when the `EmailInput` function is first called by React. At this point, the JSX has not yet been rendered to the actual browser DOM. Therefore, `document.querySelector` finds no `<input>` element, and the code crashes. Attempting to delay this code would mean we are once again fighting against React's rendering lifecycle.
2.  **The UI Will Not Update**: Even if we could successfully select the input element, there is a more critical issue. Changing the value of a standard JavaScript variable like `errorMessage` **does not trigger React to re-render the component**. React has no way of knowing that this variable has changed and that the UI needs to be updated to reflect its new value.

To create a working, dynamic component, we must solve these two problems. The correct implementation will fully embrace React's features, avoiding any mix of React and non-React code for DOM manipulation and state management. The result will be simpler, cleaner, and more efficient code.
