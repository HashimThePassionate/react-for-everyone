# 🚀 **Conditional Content and List Data**

Before exploring the techniques for outputting conditional content or list data, it is essential to first understand exactly what these terms mean.

## ❓ What is Conditional Content?

**Conditional content** simply refers to any type of content that should only be displayed under specific circumstances.

Here are a few examples:

* 🛑 **Error Overlays:** These should only appear if a user submits incorrect data in a form.
* 📋 **Additional Form Fields:** These might appear once a user chooses to enter extra details (such as business details).
* ⏳ **Loading Spinners:** This is displayed while data is being sent to or fetched from a backend server.
* 🍔 **Side Navigation Menus:** This menu slides into view only when the user clicks on a menu button.

This is just a very short list of examples. You could, of course, come up with hundreds of additional examples.

However, it should be clear what all these examples are about in the end: they are **visual elements** or entire sections of the user interface that are **only shown if certain conditions are met**.

> **Example Breakdown:** In the first example (an error overlay), the **condition** would be that a user entered incorrect data into a form. The **conditionally shown content** would then be the error overlay.

Conditional content is extremely common, since virtually all websites and web apps have some content that is similar or comparable to the preceding examples.

## 📜 What is List Data?

In addition to conditional content, many websites also output **lists of data**. It might not always be immediately obvious, but if you think about it, there is virtually no website that does not display some kind of list data.

Again, here are some examples of list data that may be outputted on a site:

* 🛍️ An online shop displaying a grid or list of products.
* 🗓️ An event booking site displaying a list of events.
* 🛒 A shopping cart displaying a list of cart items.
* 🧾 An orders page displaying a list of orders.
* ✍️ A blog displaying a list of blog posts—and maybe a list of comments below a blog post.
* 🧭 A list of navigation items in the header.

An endless list (no pun intended) of examples could be created here. Lists are everywhere on the web.

As the preceding examples show, many (probably even most) websites have multiple lists with various kinds of data on the same site.

> **Example Breakdown:** Take an online shop, for example. Here, you would have a list (or a grid, which is really just another kind of list) of products, a list of shopping cart items, a list of orders, a list of navigation items in the header, and certainly a lot of other lists as well.

This is why it is important that you know how to output any kind of list with any kind of data in React-driven user interfaces.
