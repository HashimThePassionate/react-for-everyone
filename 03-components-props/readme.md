# üöÄ **Unlocking Component Potential with Props**

So far, the components we've discussed have been static, with limited reusability. While they help in organizing code into smaller blocks, creating a new component for every single list item, for example, is not efficient. The true power of React components comes from making them **reusable** and **configurable**, much like standard HTML elements. ‚ú®

## üéØ The Analogy of HTML Elements

Think about how you use a simple HTML element like `<a>` (the anchor tag). You don't create a new type of `<a>` for every link on your website. Instead, you use the **same reusable `<a>` element** and configure it with different **attributes** and **content**.

### üìã HTML Example

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Use Google</a>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Browse Free Tutorials</a>
```

### ‚ú® Explanation

  * **Reusable Element:** Both links use the exact same `<a>` HTML element.
  * **Configuration:** The `href` attribute and the content between the tags are different for each link. This allows a single, common element to create an endless number of unique links that point to different resources.

This is the exact same kind of flexibility we need for our custom React components.

## üîë Introducing "Props"

To fully unlock the potential of React components and make them as reusable and configurable as HTML elements, React provides a key concept called **props**.

  * **Props** is short for **"properties."**
  * They are a way to pass data from a **parent component** down to a **child component**.
  * This allows you to customize the child component's content, attributes, and behavior.

# üìù **Using Props in Components**

Props, or **properties**, are how you pass data into a component to make it **reusable** and **configurable**. Using them involves two main steps: passing props to a component and consuming props inside a component.

-----

### ‚û°Ô∏è Passing Props to a Component

You pass props to a React component in JSX just like you would add attributes or content to a standard HTML element. This makes the process intuitive.

There are two primary ways to pass props:

1.  **As Attributes:** You can add custom attributes directly to your component's JSX tag. For example:

      * `<GoalItem title="Learn React" />`
      * `<CustomButton onClick={handleClick} />`

2.  **As Child Content:** You can place content between a component's opening and closing tags. This content is a special prop called **`children`**. For example:

      * `<GoalItem>Go to the gym</GoalItem>`

You can also use a mix of both methods.

### ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Consuming Props in a Component

To access the props that have been passed, your component function must receive a special parameter. React automatically passes a single **object** containing all the prop data into every component function.

#### The Problem ‚ö†Ô∏è

A function like `GoalItem` below would cause an error because `title` and `id` are not defined variables inside the function:

```jsx
function GoalItem() {
  // This will cause an error!
  return <p>{title} (ID: {id})</p>;
}
```

#### The Solution: The `props` Parameter ‚ú®

React solves this by providing a special parameter, by convention named **`props`**, as the first and only argument to your component function. This object contains all the custom attributes passed to the component.

#### üìã Code Snippet

```jsx
function GoalItem(props) {
  return (
    <p>
      {props.title} (ID: {props.id})
    </p>
  );
}
```

#### ‚ú® Detailed Code Explanation

1.  **`function GoalItem(props)`**: You must define a parameter (here, `props`) in the component function's signature. This parameter will automatically be populated with an object by React.
2.  **`{props.title}`**: Inside the JSX, you access the value of the `title` prop using dot notation on the `props` object. When a parent component uses `<GoalItem title="Go to gym" />`, the `props` object will contain `{ title: 'Go to gym' }`.
3.  **React's Role**: Remember, you don't call this function yourself. **React calls it on your behalf** and passes the props object as an argument. This is how the data gets from the parent component to the child component.
